The way I am understanding React is the 
same way I am trying to understand Ruby

With Ruby you start from the top of the script
and go to the bottom of the script.  If a script 
or function is called above the place it is defined 
it isn't loaded correctly.

This is why I usually embedd all of the calls within
definitions, and call the beginning program at the 
end of the program.  This way everything is read 
by the computer and can be called.

This is how I understand React.  It is exactly like 
a tree with its branches.   The main trunck is where 
everything is loaded for the app.js file.  Anything 
can be brough into the App.js file and loaded from 
start to finish from the beginning to the end. 
What is really good is how to load other files 
like reducers or whatever through other files.
They are exactly like branches of a tree that can 
be linked up to the trunc and called.

Logically I like to think it goes from the tip of
the branch to the bottom of the trunch when a 
branch is loaded in.  Just like originally the 
script loads from the top of the trunch to the 
bottom of the trunck.  

I should have a proof of product of this.

I should make a simple game and or finish 
the table project.
